    Count up the bands stickin' up
    No rubber band is big enough
    Chain is so heavy, can't pick it up
    Came with the gang, a myriad
    I seen your whip, hilarious
    Where is my roof? Mysterious
    My whip from Fast & Furious
    Curtains with yellow interior

    I get the commas, period
    Covered in ice, Siberia
    I'm at the top of the pyramid
    Bitch, I'm a star, I'm Sirius
    We came to play, are you serious?
    Came with the gang, a myriad
    Came with the gang, a myriad
    Came with the motley crew

    Sit up, ball, I just forgot where I was
    Pour it up, throw it up, sit up, woah
    Get up, bitch, get up, bitch, get up
    Came with a wig splitter
    I got John Wick hitters (ooh)
    I'm a go-get-getter (wow, uh)

    Came with the army, army, army, yeah (came with the army, army, army, yeah)
    The people 'round me still the same (still the same)
    We just wanna party, party, party, yeah (just wanna party, party, party, yeah)
    We rowdy and won't never change

    Count up the bands stickin' up
    No rubber band is big enough
    Chain is so heavy, can't pick it up
    Came with the gang, a myriad
    I seen your whip, hilarious
    Where is my roof? Mysterious
    My whip from Fast & Furious
    Curtains with yellow interior

    I get the commas, period
    Covered in ice, Siberia
    I'm at the top of the pyramid
    Bitch, I'm a star, I'm Sirius
    We came to play, are you serious?
    Came with the gang, a myriad
    Came with the gang, a myriad
    Came with the motley crew

    What you gon' do? I'ma pull up with the crew
    When I'm off the juice, I like to hang out the roof
    I'm rockin' jewels, I like when the diamonds, they move
    I just go through, I do not wait in the queue
    Baby, baby, pinky, Brady, Brady
    AP navy, navy, chain like two Mercedes
    I'll come when they pay me, come with Katy, Amy
    Crew go crazy, crazy, kick it, Dan Bailey (uh)

    Came with the army, army, army, yeah (came with the army, army, army, yeah)
    The people 'round me still the same (still the same)
    We just wanna party, party, party, yeah (just wanna party, party, party, yeah)
    We rowdy and won't never change

    Count up the bands stickin' up
    No rubber band is big enough
    Chain is so heavy, can't pick it up
    Came with the gang, a myriad
    I seen your whip, hilarious
    Where is my roof? Mysterious
    My whip from Fast & Furious
    Curtains with yellow interior

    I get the commas, period
    Covered in ice, Siberia
    I'm at the top of the pyramid
    Bitch, I'm a star, I'm Sirius
    We came to play, are you serious?
    Came with the gang, a myriad
    Came with the gang, a myriad
    Came with the motley crew
